# Earthly

Within the framework of the tutored projects of the first year of DUT MMI, we had to create a site to fight against a social problem. It is with my group that we created Earthmu. It's a site proposing an interactive map, as well as a forum and an editorial page. On this project, my main role was the modeling and web integration. I used Invision, then developed in HTML, CSS, jQuery and PHP.
